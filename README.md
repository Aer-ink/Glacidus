# Glacidus

## Info
For the best experience, make sure you have installed CTM (ConnectedTextureMod) or most of the visuals will not work. It is also recommended you keep music, sounds, and ambient noises on. Optifine does not work with the glowing textures (CTM), so it is recommended you don't use it.

We’re giving you Glacidus Beta, which is what we have created in a week during ModOff showing off the amount of hard work and effort we put into this. The mod is of course incomplete but that isn’t stopping us from entering. Whether we win or not, we wanted to show off a project that we’re very passionate about and that it’s goal is designed to be adventurous and immersive. Hopefully you become interested in what we truly to believe stunning in the future.

Frozen world on top and underground lies a different story. A strange alien planet with bizarre structure and thought to be impossible living conditions for life. The further down you travel -- the warmer it gets. Foliage and water can be found along with natural elements the deeper you go. This planet was once in an orbit in a solar system however, it unfortunately fell out of orbit and is parting ways and traveling space. It’s atmosphere is very thin. The planet's core is what provides the undergrounds warmth and it is considered habitable.

## Creating a portal

You will need exactly 30 packed ice blocks and 1 glowstone block. Once you are done building the portal smack that glowstone block.
